    <h1>DMCA policy</h1>
    <p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (“Policy”) applies to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
        href="index.html">texttohandwriting.com</a> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and
      services (collectively, “Services”) and outlines how this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”)
      addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you (“you” or “your”) may submit a copyright infringement
      complaint.</p>
    <p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized
      agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright
      infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) of 1998, the text of
      which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office <a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov"
        rel="noopener">website</a>. This DMCA policy was created with the DMCA policy generator.</p>
    <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
    <p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to
      contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
    <p>The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement notification. If you are
      concerned about the privacy of your personal information, you may wish to use an agent to report infringing
      material for you.</p>
    <h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
    <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services
      infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification (“Notification”)
      using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA
      requirements. You may refer to a DMCA takedown notice generator or other similar services to avoid making mistake
      and ensure compliance of your Notification.</p>
    <p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for
      accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include
      the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.</p>
    <p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged
      infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the
      removal or restriction of access.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right
      to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the
      requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>
    <p>The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to
      address suspected infringement.</p>
    <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our
      discretion. When we do, we will send you an email to notify you. We may also provide notice to you in other ways
      at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
    <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless
      otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy
      (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.</p>
    <h2>Reporting copyright infringement</h2>
